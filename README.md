# Open Terminal Here

* **Most File managers don't offer the ability to open a terminal at a certain location except through graphical means, namely the context menu, this is a (set of) script(s) to find a solution for this**\
* **For now the only script is for xfce4 Desktop / Thunar File Manager, although it can be customized/generalized for other desktops & file managers too**

## Tools for script

* xdotool

## TODO

* Try to get window class name directly from pid found in getactivewindow/getwindowfocus instead of using search & loop

* Generalize to any file manager? (use system default file manager class/name)

* Find a way to get full path from window/file manager process without it being in title
